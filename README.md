# pyRail

A Python wrapper for the iRail API, designed to make interacting with iRail simple and efficient.

## Overview
pyRail is a Python library that provides a convenient interface for interacting with the iRail API. It supports various endpoints such as stations, liveboard, vehicle, connections, and disturbances. The library includes features like caching and rate limiting to optimize API usage.

## Features
- Retrieve real-time train information, including liveboards and vehicle details.
- Access train station data, connections, and disturbances.
- Supports API endpoints: stations, liveboard, vehicle, connections, and disturbances.
- Caching and conditional GET requests using ETags.
- Rate limiting to handle API request limits efficiently.

## Installation
To install pyRail, use pip:

```bash
pip install pyrail
```

## Usage
Here is an example of how to use pyRail:

```python
from pyrail.irail import iRail

# Create an instance of the iRail class
api = iRail(format='json', lang='en')

# Make a request to the 'stations' endpoint
stations = api.get_stations()

# Print the response
print(stations)
```

## Configuration
You can configure the format and language for the API requests:

```python
api = iRail(format='json', lang='en')
```

- Supported formats: json, xml, jsonp
- Supported languages: nl, fr, en, de
